# NOTICE: material from other projects in `recipes/`

OpenVideoHarness is under the MIT License ([`../LICENSE`](../LICENSE)). The files listed below are modified versions of files from two projects under the Apache License 2.0. For these files the repository follows section 4 of that licence:

- **(a) The licence travels with them.** Each upstream `LICENSE` is in [`LICENSES/`](LICENSES/), copied byte for byte from the commit named below, copyright line included.
- **(b) Each file says it was changed.** Its 来源 section ends with a 许可 paragraph that names the project, the upstream files and the commit, and says the file is modified from them. The paragraph before it says what we changed. The `derived_from` frontmatter carries the same repository, commit and paths.
- **(c) Upstream notices are kept.** The only copyright notices in the material we used are the copyright lines of the two `LICENSE` files, `Copyright 2026 Wei Yihao` and `Copyright 2026 HeyGen, Inc.`; none of the upstream files we drew on has a header of its own. The two lines are kept in the licence copies, in this file and in every 许可 paragraph. The one attribution statement in that material, video-shotcraft's note that its transition styles B and C were reverse-engineered from frames of Linear's release film, is repeated in the 来源 sections of `seam/dark-tunnel.md` and `seam/focus-handoff.md`. video-shotcraft's `references/shots/ATTRIBUTION.md` credits the sources of 48 other cards, none of which is used here.
- **(d) NOTICE files.** Neither project has a NOTICE file at the commits used, so there is no upstream NOTICE text to carry over. HyperFrames has `skills/talking-head-recut/NOTICE.md`, which covers a skill that nothing here derives from.

The parts that come from upstream stay under Apache-2.0. Our changes, and every file in `recipes/` that is not listed here, are under this repository's MIT License. If you copy a listed file elsewhere, take its 许可 paragraph, the matching licence copy and this notice with it.

`bin/vh recipes check` enforces this for every source under Apache-2.0, MIT or CC-BY-4.0. The source needs a `commit` in `derived_from`, a licence copy in `LICENSES/`, the 许可 paragraph, and a row here that names the file and its upstream paths.

## HyperFrames

- Upstream: <https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes>, commit `a46095f1cc0b9819aeaa19ad8d9a1332ad3d38d0` (v0.8.85, 2026-09-28)
- Copyright 2026 HeyGen, Inc. Apache License 2.0
- Licence copy: [`LICENSES/Apache-2.0-hyperframes.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0-hyperframes.txt)
- The paths are the upstream ones. In the local copy, `references/fetch.sh` renames `.claude/` to `_upstream_claude/`.

## Not derived from upstream text

- `decode-type`, `gate-as-door` and `one-take-world-travel` come from this repository's intro film (`showcase/04-intro-film/`).
- `flash-stitch` comes from watching a public video; its `derived_from` says `license: none` because nothing from the video is reproduced.
- `README.md`, `_TEMPLATE.md`, the vocabularies and `tools/recipes.py` are ours. Picking shots by their frontmatter along an energy arc is an idea we took from video-shotcraft; the text and the code are new.
