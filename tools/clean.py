"""Clear a finished project's intermediate files: keep the film, its covers, captions, publishing copy, sources, docs and the
narration in use; put the rest in the Trash (or delete what the tools can make again, with --delete).

usage (via bin/vh clean): python tools/clean.py <project> [--yes] [--delete] [--keep path …] [--final path …] [--keep-versions N] [--dry-run]

Without --yes it only lists (a dry run; --dry-run says so, and wins over --yes). What goes, by kind:
  rebuilt   out/frames, out/check (check frames, contact sheets, storyboard tiles, textcheck crops: the check tools make
            them again; a video in it stays, and so do bin/vh check's records, *.check.json), out/proxy (bin/vh proxy and
            thumbs), out/cache (an edit list's chunk cache, bin/vh render), render chunks (.<film>.parts) and patch work
            folders (.<film>.patch),
            node_modules (npm ci brings it back), __pycache__, .venv and venv folders
  versions  the earlier versions of the films kept in out/versions/<id>/ (bin/vh versions), all but the newest
            --keep-versions N of each film (default 0), and folders there no version keeps; the record says where they
            went. The current films are not in there. Whether or not a film is found: the record tells them apart
  renders   video files under out/ that are not the film: drafts, video-only renders, segments, patches (*.mp4 *.mov *.webm
            *.mkv *.m4v *.avi), with their .render.json, .mux.json and .lock beside them. Only once a film is found (below)
  sound     sound files directly in audio/ that are not the narration in use (voiceover.wav, voiceover.<lang>.wav and its
            .raw.wav original, any of wav, mp3, m4a, flac, aac; <lang> like zh, en or zh-CN), not a mix (mix*, *_mix*) and not
            named in any of the project's text files (a page's <audio src>, a timeline, the notes); audio/takes/; and stem
            folders directly in audio/ (*stems*). Sound in other folders under audio/ (samples, a song's source) stays;
            a lyric video's audio/song.mp3 stays when its page names it, as it does when it plays it.
            Only once a film is found
The film: video files in out/final/ (not in a covers or 封面 folder inside it), else out/final*.<video> directly in out/,
media/*.<video>, what --final names (an existing video file, relative to the project or to here), and every copy bin/vh
deliver wrote with the master it came from (named by its record, <copy>.deliver.json, which stays too; a file that is no
longer the size or time recorded is said, and kept all the same). Covers and
out/publish/ stay, but do not count as the film. A project with no film found keeps its videos and its sound: name the
film with --final. --keep protects a path, also inside a folder that would otherwise go (the folder is then cleared item
by item around it).
What stays besides: out/review/, every other file in out/ that is not a video, timelines, scripts, src/,
assets/, lookdev/, tools/, the markdown, and any folder below the project that is a project of its own (has a BRIEF.md).
Everything goes to the Trash (macOS: /usr/bin/trash where there is one, which also handles other disks and Put Back, else
~/.Trash; Linux: the freedesktop Trash, refused for an item on another disk); --delete deletes the "rebuilt" kind outright
(the tools make it again). A video is never deleted outright: a mistaken render can come back from the Trash. Refused:
a folder without BRIEF.md, the harness itself (bin/vh, projects/), and a project where a render or a patch holds a live
lock. Nothing outside the project is touched; a symbolic link is removed as a link, never followed. What went to the
Trash frees its space when the Trash is emptied; on macOS, Time Machine's local snapshots can hold deleted data (the
Trash's too, once it is emptied) for a while: `df` may not grow at once.
Exit: 0 listed or cleared · 1 something could not be moved or deleted · 2 not a project, or refused.
