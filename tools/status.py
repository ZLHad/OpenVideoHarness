"""bin/vh status: where a project stands, from the files it already has. Read-only; no browser, no ffprobe.

usage: bin/vh status <project> [--json]
<project> is a folder (or a file inside it), or a name under $OVH_PROJECTS / projects/ (the date prefix optional).

The stops, in the pipeline's order: gate ① ② ③ always; a checkpoint E0–E5 when it has a page, a REVIEW.md section or the
BRIEF's Director line asks for it (stop=E3); a review page with another name ("final") as a stop of its own; then delivery.
Each has a state:
  done            a decision for it is on record in REVIEW.md: "定了：…" (the template's {…} does not count), in the last
                  section about its latest page (the desk's section for a submission, or one that names
                  out/review/gate-<n>.html, as the template's sections do: REVIEW.md grows downwards, so a second
                  review of the page comes after the first); with no such section, in the stop's section when REVIEW.md
                  was written after that page (said in the stop's note). Gate ① goes by gatecheck.py's own rule, as
                  bin/vh render and check do: a decision and the person's words in a gate ① section, and the concept
                  on record in DECISIONS.md
  skipped         Effort quick (and no page of its own), or waived in the user's own words in REVIEW.md
  waiting_person  its page is this round (out/review/.current) and nothing has come back for it yet
  waiting_agent   the person submitted on the desk and no agent has it yet, or an agent has it and REVIEW.md has no
                  decision for it yet; or the project moved on past its page with no decision on record; gate ①
                  decided, but its record lacks the person's words or DECISIONS.md's concept (render and check refuse)
  in_progress     the first stop with nothing yet after the last one that has something, when all before it are done or
                  skipped: what the agent works towards
  not_started     later stops; a stop passed over without a record stays not_started
  no_record       every stop of a standard or studio project with no REVIEW.md (made before the templates had one):
                  nothing to read its review from (gatecheck.py does not check those either)
Delivery is done once bin/vh deliver has written a record, or the final film (out/final*, out/final/, media/) has a passing
bin/vh check record of that very film (the size and mtime_ns it kept are the film's now; a record from before those: newer
than the film), and gate ③ is done or skipped (a delivery before it is said in the note); in progress once every stop is
done or skipped.
waiting_on: person (a stop waits for them, or REVIEW.md says the project is paused), agent (one waits for the agent,
the agent works towards one, or a command is running), nobody (delivered), or unknown (no REVIEW.md).
Also: the versions of the project's films (out/versions/versions.json, bin/vh versions; out/versions and out/proxy are not
listed as renders), the latest renders with what their sidecars say (.render.json, .deliver.json, the check record), the review items
still open (a desk submission's change and ask items whose REVIEW.md section has no 定了 / 改了 yet), the facts NOTES.md
still lists to verify, the last check, the material on record (bin/vh assets: how many, the licences not cleared, what
the films loaded that the ledger lacks, the spend against the budget), the cast in cast/ (bin/vh cast: the entries by
kind, the settled ones, what its check would fail), the research in research/ (bin/vh scout's
records, the days with a hot-list snapshot, bin/vh ref's references), and the commands running now and the last ones
(the activity log).
--json: every field (tools/desk/README.md, 给客户端的数据, has the schema; "version": 1). Exit 0, 2 when there is no project.
