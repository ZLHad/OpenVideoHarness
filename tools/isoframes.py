"""Isolated-frame scan: a frame unlike both of its neighbours while the neighbours agree with each other.

usage: uv run --with numpy python tools/isoframes.py <video> [--allow t,t,a-b,…] [--confirmed f] [--motion] [--json f]
exit status: 0 none found (or only declared, confirmed or periodic ones), 1 isolated frames found (times floored to the
             ms), 2 the video could not be read, 3 a bad --allow or an unreadable --confirmed file (bin/vh check fails on
             it, so a typo cannot switch the scan off)
  --allow  times in seconds of flashes you designed, or spans a-b: a hit within one frame of one is listed as declared and
           does not fail. For this run only: nothing is kept
  --confirmed  the project's confirmed.json (tools/confirm.py; bin/vh check passes it): a run of isolated frames confirmed
           there (check.iso, within one frame of its time) is listed as confirmed and does not fail while the picture
           there is the same: the key is two 8 x 6 thumbnails at 64 grey levels, of the frame before the run and of its
           most different frame, the same when no cell moves by more than PIC_MAX levels and the cells by PIC_MEAN on
           average (a re-encode or a 4K copy keeps it; a redrawn or retimed frame does not). The key is coarse: a small
           change inside the frame (one wrong character, a thin line) may keep it, so look again after such an edit. A
           missing file is no entries yet; each unconfirmed run gets a `confirm?` line to paste there, with why and
           evidence
  --motion also, from the same decode, how the film moves (never a failure; bin/vh check passes it): see MOTION below
  --json   every number, per frame and per finding (with its confirmation, and the entry that would confirm it), into a
           file; bin/vh check's record (tools/checkrec.py) is built from it

That is what a capture glitch looks like: a single frame that flashes another scene, or text drawn as garbage, between two
frames that are fine. The black/freeze/silence scan of `bin/vh check` cannot see it (it lasts one frame), and a snapshot
of the same time is clean, because the snapshot takes another capture path. Seen in a HyperFrames 0.8.82 render whose
drawElement capture failed its self-check and fell back to multi-worker screenshots with the browser GPU on.

Frames are decoded at 192x108 grey (108x192 for a portrait video) and compared three at a time. Frame i is isolated when
  - more than 1 % of its pixels differ by more than 12 grey levels from frame i-1,
  - the same holds against frame i+1,
  - and the share of pixels differing by more than 6 between frames i-1 and i+1 is under a quarter of the smaller of those.
A cut never qualifies (the frames on either side of it differ); a one-frame flash inside a shot does, intended or not.
What it cannot see: a glitch two or more frames long (a run of bad frames looks like motion), the first and last frame,
glitches under 1 % of the picture (a few garbled characters), and any frame whose neighbours already differ by a quarter
of the picture or more (particles, camera moves, line boil): those frames are counted (leaving out the one or two a cut
makes) and their stretches of half a second or more listed, so strip-check them.

Periodic motion: an oscillation can land on its still point once a cycle, and that frame looks isolated. Four or more
hits evenly spaced (within a frame; one every 4 frames to 2 s), each small (at most 25 % of the picture) and alike in
size, are reported as periodic motion and do not fail; looked for only when there are 50 hits or fewer, since a render
with more is broken. Keep a periodic motion under a quarter of the frame rate, as a smooth cosine (playbook/03).

MOTION (--motion). Same 192x108 grey frames. The thresholds are first guesses checked on a few films, not rules
(docs/research/07-motion-checks.md has the numbers): every line is a warning to look at, never a failure.
  cuts     a frame where over 30 % of the pixels change by more than 12 levels, the mean change is over 18 and over 3 times
           the median of the 10 frames around it: a hard cut. A cut after which the brightest of the next 3 frames is at
           least 170 of 255 and over 90 above the mean of the 3 before is listed: dark to bright in one frame reads as a
           flash (a one-frame white flash between two dark shots too).
  static   runs where no frame differs from the one before it on more than 0.2 % of its pixels (by more than 6 levels;
           film grain stays under that at this size): nothing the eye reads as moving. The share of the film in runs of
           2 s or more goes on the summary line; runs of 3 s or more are listed, each said to be frozen (not even frames a
           second apart differ) or a slow drift. Black runs (under 2 % of the pixels above 25 of 255) are left to blackdetect; a
           held formula on a black background is not black.
  summary  the share of frame pairs where over 0.5 % of the picture changes, the hard cuts, the still share, and the
           largest jump inside a shot: leaving out 0.35 s after each cut and changes as large as a cut, a frame-to-frame
           change over 8 times the shot's median (and over 6 levels) in a shot that moves at all. On the showcase films
           those were designed pops and fast pushes, so it is only a number on the summary line, not a warning.
