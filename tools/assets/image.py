"""bin/vh image: generated pictures, made once into files and kept on record (a keyframe for gate ②, a plate behind the

  gen      one picture a call (--n: that many calls), into assets/genimg/<id>/: image.jpg from Gemini (it sends JPEG
           only), image.png from Codex (image-1.jpg … with --n),
           prompt.txt and request.json (what was asked, never a key), and a contact sheet (sheet.png) when there are
           several. Each picture is one record in assets/ledger.json: aigc, the model, the prompt file, the seed, what it
           cost and the reference images it was given (inputs).
           gemini (the default): Google's Interactions API with GEMINI_API_KEY (the key in a header only). --tier draft
           (the default) is Nano Banana 2.1, for exploring and gate ② keyframes, asked to think at its minimal level (it
           thinks at medium unless told, and thinking is billed); --tier final is Nano Banana Pro, for a
           picture that goes on screen; --model names another (prices lists them). --size: 1K, 2K or 4K (default 1K
           draft, 2K final); --aspect: 1:1, 3:2, 2:3, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9 (default from the BRIEF's
           Output, else 16:9); --ref: reference pictures (up to 14; they are uploaded to the vendor: ask first when one
           shows a real person or something confidential); --seed: sent as given, else a random one, recorded either way.
           Every call is paid: it is held against the project's budget first (tools/assets/budget.py: no budget, or one it
           would go over, and the call is not made, with how much is missing), and settled at what the answer's usage
           says it cost, a blocked answer's input and thinking too. An error answer (HTTP 4xx/5xx) and a request that
           never left settle at 0; a timeout, a reset or an answer that cannot be read keep the estimate as spent, as
           such a call may have been billed (said so).
           codex: the Codex CLI's image_gen, on the ChatGPT plan the CLI is signed in with: not billed per picture, so
           no budget is held (as bin/vh tts on a plan's quota); no seed, no size. A transparent background comes from
           the model itself. The model is the one the user's Codex config names (none is set here; only the
           reasoning effort is, low: making a picture is one tool call); when codex makes nothing, its own
           error is said, with what to change (a model a ChatGPT login cannot use: a newer CLI, or another
           model in config.toml).
           --alpha: a transparent background. Gemini has none of its own: the picture is asked for on flat chroma green
           and cut out (cutout below) into cutout.png beside it; codex is asked for a transparent PNG.
           --dry-run: the estimate and the budget's verdict, nothing called. Pictures that go on screen are AI-generated
           content (bin/vh assets credits says so for the upload); no real people, and nothing passed off as a news photo
           or a record of what happened
  cutout   a transparent background for a picture on a flat colour: the key colour measured on its border (auto) or
           given, ffmpeg chromakey and despill (playbook/05's 绿幕), into <name>.cutout.png beside it, on record and
           derived from it. It says the spill left on the edge band (G − max(R, B) where the alpha is between 0.05 and
           0.95; over about 4 levels a green fringe shows) and writes <name>.cutout-check.png: the cutout on black, white
           and paper, to look at the edges
  prices   the models gen knows, a picture's price at each size, and what a reference picture and the thinking add
--json: {"version": 1, "tool", …}; the lines go to stderr. --offline DIR: the answers from DIR/responses.json, recorded
before (CONTRIBUTING.md, 联网的命令); no network, and nothing held or spent (the budget's verdict still applies, as it
would to a call): the record has no cost and says it was replayed. A stand-in codex on the PATH answers for the Codex CLI.
Exit: 0 · 1 a call refused by the budget, or failed · 2 usage: no prompt, no key (said by its name), no such file.
The Codex route follows lemo-opuscar's styles/news-package/demo/tools/gen_image.py (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 LemoLab): codex
exec in a read-only sandbox told to call image_gen once, the picture found under generated_images or in the session log by
a job token. The code is written anew; the Interactions request and answer follow Google's API reference (2026-10-26).
