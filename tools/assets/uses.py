"""What a project's films and mixes used, read from the records the tools already keep, and how that squares with the
ledger. Stdlib only; nothing is hashed here (the records carry the sha256s).

  films   each video under out/ (three levels down, not out/versions/ or out/proxy/), renders/ and media/ whose
          .render.json has `files`: every file bin/vh render (or patch) sent the page, and its sha256, by its path from the
          page's folder. Of the films of one page only the newest counts (an old draft's files are history): the one
          made last by its version (out/versions/versions.json, bin/vh versions), else by its file's time, a whole
          render (from frame 0) before a span of one. film= compares that one film, all_films= every one. A film whose
          sidecar has no `files` (rendered before they were recorded, or patched since without them) is named as one
          whose files are not known; a video with no sidecar (mux's, npx hyperframes render's, Manim's) is not a render here
  mixes   each <mix>.mix.json (bin/vh mix): its inputs, from the mix's folder, and their sha256
uses(project, film=None, all_films=False) → {"films": [{"film", "sidecar", "page", "files": {path: sha256}}], "older": [the
films of a page left out], "unknown": [films], "mixes": [{"mix", "inputs": {path: sha256}}]}, every path relative to the
project (absolute outside it). ValueError: film= names no film with its files on record.

compare(entries, used, policy) → the findings of the two directions, for the records not removed:
  unregistered  material a film's page loaded that no record covers (a record's path, or a folder record above it):
                fail. Material: images, video, sound, fonts, 3D models, tables (csv, tsv, xlsx, parquet, geojson);
                the page's code and its own JSON and text are not
  stale         a record whose file a film loaded with other bytes than the ledger has: warn (render again, or --update)
  unused        a record no film loaded, no mix used, nothing declares a use of (used_by) and no record made from it
                (derived_from) is used: warn; said only when at least one film's files are known
  mix           the sound files a mix used that no record covers: one info line (a TTS take is AI-generated: register it)
overview(project) → the counts bin/vh status gives (version 1 of its "assets" field): records, uncleared, not_taken,
aigc, unregistered, policy, and the budget (budget.summary()'s shape).
